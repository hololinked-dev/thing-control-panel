## I Have a Question

Do feel free to reach out to me at vignesh.vaidyanathan@hololinked.dev. This project is only upcoming, so inquries are dealt case to case. 
There can significant improvements made, so feel free to propose ideas. They can be solidified and integrated.

## I wish to contribute to issues

Find an issue you like and comment on it (good first issue or not), I can assign it to you. 

Please bear in mind that if you are using AI heavily, reviews get harder. So kindly make sure yourself that it is a good code base that you would integrate into your own production project, whether AI generated or not.
